# Mission-to-Mars

## Challenges

This challenge was straight forward in the beginning in my attempt to finish the challenge I ran into an issue with the instructions on the moduel.  The website https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars layout changed so I could not locate the full image and more info portion of the moduel when I tried to redue it as a refresher. I also managed to confuse myself with the file formats put exported them from Jupyter in that format. With the many things that I experienced. I thought this was a pretty cool moduel, I love having the knowledge of looking in the detail of a website with the inspection option. In gaining that knowledge I now have tools to show my future upcoming coders.
